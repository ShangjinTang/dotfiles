## Installation

1. Setup a proxy (China Mainland only)

   If you are in China Mainland, please use a proxy to bypass GFW before installation. Otherwise some steps may fail.

   ```bash
   vim ~/.zshrc.private
   ```

   ```bash
   export PROXY_IP="127.0.0.1:7890"
   export PROXY_ENABLED=1
   ```

   For more customized environments, see [zshrc.pre](https://github.com/ShangjinTang/dotfiles/blob/master/configs/zsh/zshrc.pre)

2. Add essential required packages

   - **Arch Linux x86_64**

     ```bash
     sudo pacman -Sy base-devel python git zsh vim net-tools wget xclip curl ripgrep
     chsh -s $(which zsh)
     ```

   - **Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64**

     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install -y build-essential python3 python-is-python3 git zsh vim net-tools wget xclip curl ripgrep
     ```

3. Change shell to zsh

   ```bash
   chsh -s $(which zsh)
   ```

   Log out and re-login to make sure the shell is changed to `zsh`.
